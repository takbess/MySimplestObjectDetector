# MySimplestObjectDetector
I made one simplest object detection task and a model to study object detection.

This project is not working well.

9/2 I reorganized the codes so that I can easily try many models and hyperparameters.

See detail for https://stackoverflow.com/questions/76918031/my-simplest-neural-network-object-detector-not-working-well-pytorch

9/10 I moved all old files into old folder. I am now reorganizing the codes.

9/23 I finished reorganizing. Next, I want to make all the settings including model config come from config yaml file.

9/26 I added hydra configs and logger.

9/27 I added mlflow.

Todo: add model change configs, optuna. Idk now to use MaxPooling... I may also try adding more layers.
